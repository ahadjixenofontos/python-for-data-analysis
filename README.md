# Python for data analysis

The data used for this workshop was downloaded from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [open data portal](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Chronic-Disease-Indicators/U-S-Chronic-Disease-Indicators-CDI-/g4ie-h725) in May of 2017. 

The objective of the workshop is not only to expose students to working with nympy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, but primarily to illustrate the thought process that drives a data analysis. 

Discussions of bias, quality control, missing data and other key decisions that are made during a data analysis are intended to prime students to think like data scientists. 

The hands-on parts of the exploratory notebook covers pandas dataframes, plotting descriptive plots and handling of missing data. 

In the deeper dive notebook, we then go into refining the questions that we'd like to answer based on this data, and perform a t-test for the difference between two means. 

Note: This repo does not include notes on whiteboard work that demonstrates how the t-test works and connects it to power calculations as well as the reasons why violation of assumptions lead to unreliable estimates.
